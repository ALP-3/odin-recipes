First HTML recipes project
This is my first HTML project with TOP. I have a decent understand of html at this point but this project will surmise if ive retained what I've leared well enough.
I will update after the projects completion and report any difficulties or issues.

This project was very simple and helped reinforce using commits and pushing to git. I was initially concerned about when to commit, but that quickly resolved itself after doing it. I will have to be mindful about that as i proceed in this course.

On another note, I find myslef to be enjoying utilizing the CL and terminal to navigate around. It was jarring and frusturating at first but now its actually enjoyable and straightforward.
